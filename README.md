## Hi, I'm Alex ❄️

I'm an (incoming) Computer Science student interested in programming, game development, and building things that actually work.

_Currently, I'm focused on:_
- Learning C# and GDScript Fundamentals
- Building small projects to understand program structure, logic, and how to finish things
- Making small games in Godot

_I’m especially interested in:_
- Game systems and gameplay logic
- Backend-style problem solving
- Turning ideas into finished, working projects

This GitHub is a record of my learning and progress over time.
By design, projects here are small. The goal is consistency and not perfection.

Outside of code, I also make music and enjoy storytelling.
I sometimes publish creative projects under the alias “**criorre**.”
